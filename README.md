[00:07.33] So many weeks, still had to sleep
[00:10.19] In this kingsize bed alone
[00:12.25] Thoughts in my head, keep coming back
[00:14.35] I can't seem to let them go
[00:27.85] 
[00:17.28] Feeling so lonely, but I won't let them own me
[00:21.73] I wanna cry it out, to all the tears I got
[00:26.02] Somebody show me how to not go crazy
[00:30.21] Didin't I tell myself that this is what I want?
[00:53.71] 
[00:34.44] When you were with me, mm nana
[00:37.77] Life was a beach yeah, mm nana
[00:39.83] Now I can see, the tracks on your feet
[00:41.93] They don't lead up to me, nana
[00:44.04] When you were with me, mm nana
[00:46.11] Life was a beach yeah, mm nana
[00:48.38] Now I can see it's not meant to be
[00:50.42] But I still got me, mm nana
[01:03.92] 
[01:01.03] You were the place where I was safe
[01:03.23] Let you close like no one else
[01:05.39] I need some time, trying to find
[01:07.45] Just kinda home inside myself
[01:21.95] 
[01:09.90] I'm feeling so lonely, but I won't let it own me
[01:14.75] I wanna cry it out, to all the tears I got
[01:19.09] Somebody show me how to not go crazy
[01:23.47] Didn't I tell myself that this is what I want?
[01:46.47] 
[01:27.58] When you were with me, mm nana
[01:30.79] Life was a beach yeah, mm nana
[01:33.01] Now I can see, the tracks on your feet
[01:35.03] They don't lead up to me, nana
[01:37.07] When you were with me, mm nana
[01:39.26] Life was a beach yeah, mm nana
[01:41.46] Now I can see it's not meant to be
[01:43.52] But I still got me, mm nana
[01:57.02] 
[01:54.15] I found someone, found someone to talk to
[01:57.83] And I admit, we've been talking about you
[02:02.68] I found someone, who helped me deal with it so well
[02:06.82] By the way, her name is Zel
[02:09.06] By the way, her name is Zel
[02:22.56] 
[02:12.08] When you were with me, mm nana
[02:15.43] Life was a beach yeah, mm nana
[02:17.60] Now I can see, the tracks on your feet
[02:19.76] They don't lead up to me, nana
[02:21.67] When you were with me, mm nana
[02:23.81] Life was a beach yeah, mm nana
[02:26.08] Now I can see it's not meant to be
[02:28.18] But I still got me, mm nana
